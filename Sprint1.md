## Failures
Backend: 
- Could not figure out how to host package from github; decided to do it locally for the time being and fixing in sprint 2 ([#65](https://github.com/TylerMetz/Saucier720/issues/65))

**Frontend**: 
- We did not get unit tests properly set up. We plan to focus on this a lot more in Sprint 2 to ensure our code continues to work. We also wanted to try communication with backend but was not able to complete that this sprint so we used a mocked up backend for our pantry page. We plan to have communication with backend completed by sprint 2.
