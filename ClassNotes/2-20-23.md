## Flow of Information
### Components
- **FrontEnd**: Angular
    - Get info from user(models or other interactive inputs)
    - Display "templates" to collect information(buttons or input bars)
    - Give it to a SERVICE (like how we get the pantry page rn)
        - we need to setup the HTML client service
    - send it to the backend
    - wait
    - take result and post-process it
    - post-process just is a way to standardize the data for when you display it to the user and could even be done in the service (up to us)
    - provide result to the component
- **BackEnd**
    - use `GO` keyword for multiple threads
    - implements a router (GorillaMux)
    - send info from FrontEnd to handling functions
        - you should test that info is reasonable
        - error handling needs to be setup here
- **Database**
    - almost all applications can work wth SQLite3
    - can use datbase servers: MySQL/MariaDB, PostgresSQL, Oracle, MS SQLserver
    - holds consistent data
    - hardest to SCALE (performance comes here to die)
### Workflow
FrontEnd => BackEnd => DataBase => BackEnd => FrontEnd

## Promises in TypeScript
- seem like a way to improve performance
- allows multiple threads to run at the same time
