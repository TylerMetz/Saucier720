- Create a label for User Stories
- User story should create a way for who/when/how a user would want to interact with the app
- Can refactor at end of sprints and see if that user story is still reasonable and provides an active goal
- As a < type of user > I want < some goal >  so that < some reason >
- The user story should make sense from the POV of the user. Even if it makes it more convoluted for the developer ;(
- Wants **COPIOUS** amounts of user stories for Sprint 0

## User Story Examples
```
- As a site member, I can fill out an application to become a Certified Scrum Trainer so that I can teach CSM and CSPO courses and certify others.
As a trainer, I want my profile to list my upcoming classes and include a link to a detailed page about each so that prospective attendees can find my courses.
- As a site visitor, I can access old news that is no longer on the home page, so I can access things I remember from the past or that others mention to me.
- As a site visitor, I can see a list of all upcoming “Certification Courses” and can page through them if there are a lot, so I can choose the best course for me.
