# Getting Started with Testing
- only needed for sprint 2, just be ready

## TDD (Test Driven Development)
- you can write tests ensuring that something works
- if you break it later you find out now
- the longest time in fixing a bug is actually finding it so if you have these tests find them as they happen it saves a lot of developmet time

## Web Testing
- must simulate user (them clicking buttons etc...)
- cypress

## We Need
- need unit tests
- functional tests
- end => end tests (cypress?)
