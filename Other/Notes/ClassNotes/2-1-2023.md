## **There are as many testing frameworks as there are mushrooms in the forest** - Alin

### **Unit Test Workflow**
1. Write a test (defining some functionality)
2. Ensure the test fails
3. Write the code to pass the test
4. Ensure the test passes
5. Watch forever and hopefully the test never breaks
6. Refactor as needed

### **Testing Bad Things**
- ensure that even with bad inputs you still get the proper eroor (throwing the correct error)

### Testing in GO
- GO has a built in testing library
