# How To Name Your Branch (Draft)
In order to achieve a more organized workflow, branches should have cohesive conventions across the entire project to ensure each contributor has an idea of what each branch is meant for. 

## Proposed Conventions
Each branch should be built with the following components: 

- The type of issue
- Issue Number
- A passive description of the issue at hand

## Example

The issue this contributes to is #390. Here is how a potential branch would be named:

> DOC-390-NamingConventions

- DOC = Document type issue
- 390 = Issue Number
- NamingConventions = Passive description 

Even if you are just adding a file to the repo as a whole, if we look back we will be able to understand what was going on in each step of our workflow. 

## Example issue ideas 
- BUG - bug
- ENH - enhancement
- DOC - documentation 
- WIP - work in progress 
- TST - testing

*We would need to make some labels*
