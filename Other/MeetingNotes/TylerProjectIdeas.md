# Project Ideas
## Music but Social Media
There are very easy ways to mke playlists on spotify but it is harder to share and discover new ones from other people. There are many features that would come from having a way for users to make "playlists" (lists of songs) and then share them with other users.
### Features
1. **Users**
Each user would have an account and a way to store their playlists, followers, and who they are following
2. **Playlists**
We could have a [database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs) of a bunch of songs that the users would then be able to select from
3. **Search** We would probably use SQL for this 1.2M database for runtime. But we need to have queries to lookup a song by Artist and by Song Name
4. **Spotipi** We could have the playlist automatically make a playlist for you on your account. Riley and I have used Spotipi before to play songs from spotify but it also allows you to make playlists in python. Im sure there is someway we could implement it online
5. **So Much More** I think there is a lot more we can brainstorm to add for this project. Music is cool!
